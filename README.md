# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with SARIMAXs: An Intro


This repository presents in two notebooks some basics about time series and introduces SARIMAX models and their assumptions.

In **[01-intro-time-series.ipynb](https://github.com/thuduongAB/time_series_notebook/blob/main/01-intro-time-series.ipynb)** you learn about time series properties and how to identify them using both statistical and graphical tools.

Next, in **[02-SARIMAX-model.ipynb](https://github.com/thuduongAB/time_series_notebook/blob/main/02-SARIMAX-model.ipynb)** you are introduced to ARIMA models and its variants. 

## :file_folder: Data

In the pratical examples we used the following data:

1. Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudhanshu2198/time-series-analysis-using-linear-regression/data) consisting 
dummy time series data starting at `2016-01-15` till week starting at `2022-01-12`. 

2. [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) consisting on how many times the word `diet` was searched in US in the period from the week starting at `2016-03-27` till week starting at `2021-03-21`.
